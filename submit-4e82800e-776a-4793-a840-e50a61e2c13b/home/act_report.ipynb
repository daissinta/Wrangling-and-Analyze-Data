    "### Introduction \n",
    "Real-world data is rarely clear. The dataset we've been processing (and analyzing and visualizing) here is the archive of tweets from Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.Our tasks in this project were the following:\n",

    "### Step 1: data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "data was collected from three different sources:\n",

    "* Additional Twitter API Data\n",
    "### Step 2: data evaluation\n",
    "We used two types of evaluation:\n",
    "* Visual evaluation: Each piece of collected data is displayed in the Jupyter notebook for visual evaluation.\n",
    "* Programmatic evaluation: pandas functions and methods are used to evaluate data.\n",
    "### step 3 : data cleaning\n",
    "The cleaning process involves three\n",
    "steps:\n",
    "1. Define: determine exactly what needs to be cleaned, and how\n",
    "2. Code: programmatically clean the code\n",
    "3. Test: evaluate the code to ensure the data set was cleaned properly\n",
    "### step 3 :Analyze and visualize the data\n",
    "we did three analyzes with a visualization:\n",
    " * analyze 1: he correlation between favorite and retweet ?:\n",
